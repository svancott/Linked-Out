# LinkedOut

Are you like me and have way too many bookmarks? You love finding great material but can't read it all at once. You make it a bookmark and promise you'll get back to it later. It then gets piled among all the others and lost forever... Do you know what our problem is?

## We're LinkedOUT!

*LinkedOut* helps you organize your overabundance of bookmarks so you never lose track of those potentially life changing resources again! Better yet, you can easily share them with friends and coworkers!

Give __**LinkedOut**__ and shot a cure your bookmarking troubles forever.

# About me

I'm a developer who's passionate about writing good code and loves the satisfaction of solving problems.

I've developed several apps using JavaScript, AngularJS, jQuery, and Ruby on Rails, using Git/Github as well as Heroku.

I'm also experienced HTML5 and CSS, and have worked with SQL and Firebase.

Currently, I'm looking for a developer role at a company that's as passionate as I am about doing good work.
